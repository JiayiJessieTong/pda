Description: A set of algorithms for conducting statistical regression analyses using multi-site data, 
  for example the electronic healthcare record (EHR) data. The regression analyses can be 
  linear regression for continunous outcome, logistic regression for binary outcome, 
  Cox PH regression for time-to event outcome or Poisson regression for count outcome. 
  The PDA algorithm runs on a lead site and only requires some summary statistics rather than
  the individual patient-level data (IPD) from the other sites, in one or few iterations.   
  The distributed algorithm is expected to obtain similar result as if all the IPD are available.
  Currently logistic regression and Cox regression are implemented and the summary statistics are
  communicated on https://pda.one/ via webdav.
