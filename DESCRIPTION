Description: A collection of privacy-preserving distributed algorithms for conducting multi-site data analyses. The regression analyses can be linear regression for continuous outcome, logistic regression for binary outcome, Cox proportional hazard regression for time-to event outcome, or Poisson regression for count outcome. The PDA algorithm runs on a lead site and only requires summary statistics from collaborating sites, with one or few iterations.
